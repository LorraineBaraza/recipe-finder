The Recipe Finder App is a simple web application that allows users to search for recipes based on dietary preferences. It fetches data from the Spoonacular API and displays recipe details asynchronously. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience. It features a search bar for entering keywords, diet filters for dietary restrictions, and a Back to Top Button for easy navigation. Recipes are fetched and displayed dynamically using asynchronous API calls, and users can view detailed instructions for each recipe. The UI includes hover effects for a better experience and is fully responsive. The app fetches data in JSON format from the Spoonacular API, allowing seamless communication between the frontend and the API. To install, clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/LorraineBaraza/recipe-finder, open index.html in your browser, and (optionally) replace YOUR_API_KEY in script.js with a valid Spoonacular API key. Example API request: fetch("https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch?apiKey=6249e493baaa4907a4c3c7adb7b651bc&query=pasta"), which returns JSON data like { "results": [ { "id": 12345, "title": "Vegetarian Pasta", "image": "https://example.com/pasta.jpg" } ], "offset": 0, "number": 10, "totalResults": 100 }. Future improvements include user authentication, UI enhancements, and pagination for search results. The website is open-source, with API provided by Spoonacular, and is licensed under MIT. 

N/B: Spoonacular API sends data in json format by default.
